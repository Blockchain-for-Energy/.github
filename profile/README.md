## About Us

Formally known as the OOC Blockchain Consortium, Blockchain For Energy is building a network of business partners to create industry solution frameworks and guidelines leveraging blockchain technology to maximize opportunities to reduce costs, improve timelines and eliminate disputes in any given process.
 
Through industry collaboration and execution of several multi-function use cases across the oil and gas value chain, we are exploring the potential of this transformative technology. Our Technical Committees are driving industry alignment and harmonizing blockchain-related guidelines. These exploration efforts will also encompass other technologies that could supplement or complement blockchain, to enhance our overall solutions. Through these learnings, we are positioning ourselves and our members to drive optimal blockchain solutions at scale for the industry.
